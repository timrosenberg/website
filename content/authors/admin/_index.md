I am the Visiting Assistant Professor of Saxophone at Stetson University. My teaching interests include saxophone, chamber music, avant-garde music, jazz improvisation, and music technology.

I frequently perform with several ensembles, including the Hippocrene Saxophone Quartet, the Brevard Symphony Orchestra and the Binghamton Symphony Orchestra. In the past I also performed with the H2 Quartet, the Hyperbaton Ensemble and the Cayuga Saxophone Quartet. I can be heard on _Intersecciones_ on the Ashes Records label and _Times & Spaces_ on Blue Griffin Records.
