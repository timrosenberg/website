Samuel Coleridge-Taylor was a British composer, conductor, and political activist. Both of his parents were musicians, which led to Samuel entering the Royal College of Music at age 15. The _Romance_ in G Major was first published in 1900, when Samuel was 25 years old, as a piece for violin and orchestra. It was later released in an arrangement for violin and piano. Christopher Creviston created this arrangement for tenor saxophone and piano, showing off the range and tonal possibilities of the saxophone.
