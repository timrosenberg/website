I proposed four new arrangements of ragtime pieces for saxophone and piano. These pieces will be valuable additions to the repertoire. They are challenging and exciting for the performers, yet accessible for any audience. 
 
The pieces include works by three composers from Michigan: Charlotte Blake, William Bolcom, and William Albright. I conceived of this particular set of rags as a "conversation" between these three composers across time and space. Bolcom and Albright were colleagues and friends. As students of ragtime music, surely they were/are familiar with Charlotte Blake's music. Blake lived until 1979; so, it's possible they all actually met!
 
Ragtime music is exciting and fun for both performers and audiences. Given the success of works such as Jean Matitia's The Devil's Rag, and the numerous arrangements of Scott Joplin's music for saxophones, I believe these works will be adopted by the saxophone community and played often.
