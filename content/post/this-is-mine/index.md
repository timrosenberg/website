[In the style of [Brent Musberger](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/college-football/brent-musburgers-iconic-you-are-looking-live-catchphrase-began-as-a-nod-to-vegas)] *You are looking live* at the newest iteration of my website, my space on the Internet (where I will capitalize _Internet_ according to my own style guide, [the gods be damned](https://expresswriters.com/chicago-style-adapts-to-online-grammar/)), my little bit of earth to [cultivate](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0143039423/ref=nosim/themillpw-20), my pixel palace, and—most importantly—*mine*. Not Elon's, or Zuck's, or spez's, or whomever will eventually replace them. 

[In the words of Andy Baio](https://waxy.org/2012/04/happy_10th_birthday_waxy/):
> Carving out a space for yourself online, somewhere where you can express yourself and share your work, is still one of the best possible investments you can make with your time.
And that is what I'm doing here. I'm not sure how much personal vs. professional content I'll post. These days, those two parts of my life blend together so much they are difficult to separate. 

Sure, I'll still check into the latest doom-site to see what is going on, and I'll probably post a little bit too; but, I'm doing it less and less these days. Instead, I want to use my rather limited time doing something better with my brain—or at least something that *feels* better. I want to create and I want to share. I want to ruminate and follow rabbit holes to the ends of the capital-I Internet, posting the best tidbits I discover along the way. Not for you—no, for *me*—both present and future me.

"But, Tim," you complain "that is not how the Internet works! You are supposed to *entertain me!*" Didn't you read? This isn't here *for you*. It's for me. You are welcomed—nay *invited* to look on. But, there is no transaction here. There's no tracking, no analytics, no cookies—I'll never know what you click or how long you stay. The only way I'll ever know about you, dear reader, is if you [tell me about it](https://timothyrosenberg.com/#contact). And know that I will be delighted to hear from you! We could be blog buddies like it's 1997. I would like that.

So, there it is: the first post. The tearing off of the proverbial band-aid. The mindless doodle on the first page of a fresh notebook. Don't worry—I'll get better at this. It's a start.
